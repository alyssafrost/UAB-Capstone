# Smarthome Simulation 

This is the private GitLab repository for UAB's CS 499 Capstone class's smarthome project.

## Description
---

This application is a React webapp that will simulate an app in which one would interact with a smarthome in an individual's household.

The Home IoT project will 
simulate sensor data and user interaction with a smart home. 
There are two main parts to the project â€“ 
1. Sensor data generation and 
2. User interaction (inputs and 
outputs) with the system.

An [article](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/) that discusses **practical Git commit messages**, that is resourceful to read even for the most experienced developers. I definitely recommend giving it a look over!

Since we decided on [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), the documentation is integral to familiarizing yourself with the ins-and-outs.

This is the [link](https://www.javascript.com/) to the primary **JavaScript** website, that tells you about the language and gives you a beginner example. 

Here is the [link](https://reactjs.org/) to **React.js**'s website, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

# Smarthome Simulation 

This is the private GitLab repository for UAB's CS 499 Capstone class's smarthome project.

## Description
---

This application is a React webapp that will simulate an app in which one would interact with a smarthome in an individual's household.

The Home IoT project will 
simulate sensor data and user interaction with a smart home. 
There are two main parts to the project â€“ 
1. Sensor data generation and 
2. User interaction (inputs and 
outputs) with the system.

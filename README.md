## Description
---
The Home IoT project will 
simulate sensor data and user interaction with a smart home. 
There are two main parts to the project â€“ 
1. Sensor data generation and 
2. User interaction (inputs and 
outputs) with the system. 

Some project elements will be required in every teams' project and some will 
be chosen by the teams. The project will handle both current state information (I.e. what are the 
sensors indicating right now) and historical information (I.e. what did the sensors report for the last X 
days).

An [article](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/) that discusses **practical Git commit messages**, that is resourceful to read even for the most experienced developers. I definitely recommend giving it a look over!

Since we decided on [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), the documentation is integral to familiarizing yourself with the ins-and-outs.

This is the [link](https://www.javascript.com/) to the primary **JavaScript** website, that tells you about the language and gives you a beginner example. 

Here is the [link](https://reactjs.org/) to **React.js**'s website, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
